TODO List

This is a simple example of todo list in which we can perform crud without reloading the page.

This Laravel app has login and registeration page so we can add new user to the app.

After adding the user we can login and create ,read, update and delete the task.

This app support soft delete so we can also restore the some task from trash if we delete items from the trash we will not able to recover the task.

This code use jquery to perform all the task using ajax so that page doesn't reload on any action.
